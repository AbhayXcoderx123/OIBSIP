        <p>
          Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic
          Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a
          junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the
          death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely
          symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a
          hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in
          Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab
          region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero
          in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, he
          electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted
          urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent
          but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.

        <p>
          In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru,
          both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist
          Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old
          British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is
          today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for
          the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had
          intended to assassinate. They held Scott responsible for the death of
          a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having ordered
          a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks
          thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station
          on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across
          the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he was shot at
          close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing
          eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad,
          shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who
          attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.
        </p>
        <p>
          After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used pseudonyms
          to publicly announce avenging Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared
          posters that they had altered to show John Saunders as their intended
          target instead of James Scott. Singh was thereafter on the run for
          many months, and no convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again
          in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two
          low-intensity homemade bombs among some unoccupied benches of the
          Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the
          gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and allowed the
          authorities to arrest them. The arrest, and the resulting publicity,
          brought to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case.
          Awaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow
          defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison
          conditions for Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's death from
          starvation in September 1929.

            He was secretary of the Kirti Kisan Party when it organised an
            all-India meeting of revolutionaries in September 1928 and he later
            became its leader.

            Opposition in India to the Simon Commission was not universal. For
            example, the Central Sikh League, some Hindu politicians, and some
            members of the Muslim League agreed to co-operate.

            An example of the methods adopted to counterattack attempts at
            force-feeding is the swallowing of red pepper and boiling water by a
            prisoner called Kishori Lal. This combination made his throat too
            sore to permit entry of the feeding tube.

            Singh incorrectly referred to Niralamba Swami as the author of the
            book, however Niralamba had only written the introduction.

            In his own account of the meeting though, Randhir Singh says that
            Bhagat Singh repented for giving up his religion and said that he
            did so only under the influence of irreligious people and in search
            of personal glory. Certain Sikh groups periodically attempt to
            reclaim Bhagat Singh as a Sikh based on Randhir Singh's writings.
